The trooper and the civilian ""ride-along"", a 20-year-old college freshman, observed a vehicle stop several feet before the toll booth on the 836 Expressway. After Trooper Glascock pulled up behind the car, the driver pulled through the toll booth without paying. Trooper Glascock stopped the vehicle, and as he was getting out, the suspect began backing up. Trooper Glascock backed his vehicle up to avoid a collision. This happened several times, and at that point, Trooper Glascock told his ride-along that he intended to arrest the suspect. Trooper Glascock and the suspect both exited their vehicles and exchanged words. The suspect then fled back to his vehicle, where he retrieved a .38-caliber handgun and shot Trooper Glascock twice, killing him. The suspect then entered his vehicle. The ride-along unlocked the 12-gauge shotgun that was mounted in the patrol car, loaded it, and opened fire at the suspect. The suspect sped away, but not before the ride-along was able to fire four shots, wounding him. The ride-along then radioed for help. Trooper Glascock was transported to the hospital where he was pronounced dead. A massive manhunt ensued. Working with the description that the ride-along provided, along with a partial license plate of the suspect's vehicle, the police were able to identify the suspect. During the investigation, the suspect’s vehicle was recovered along with the 38-caliber Titen revolver used to kill the trooper. Roadblocks were set up all over Miami, and after two days, the suspect turned himself in because he was unable to get out of town. The 31-year-old suspect pled guilty to first-degree murder and was sentenced to life in prison. He was denied parole in 2011 and again in 2017. As of November 23, 2020, he was in prison. Trooper Glascock's murder spurred the state cabinet to buy bullet-resistant vests for all state troopers. Trooper Glascock had served with the Florida Highway Patrol for one year. He was survived by his parents, brother, and sister.","BIO Age 24 Tour 1 year Badge Not available INCIDENT DETAILS Cause Gunfire Weapon Handgun; .38 caliber Offender Sentenced to life Illegal Alien, Traffic Stop Powered by Esri Zoom In Zoom Out Expand LODD Mapping FAQs",INCIDENT DETAILS Cause Gunfire Weapon Handgun; .38 caliber Offender Sentenced to life

He stopped to assist the motorist whose vehicle had become stuck on a swale. He had positioned his patrol car behind the vehicle and completed paperwork for approximately one hour while the motorist waited for a tow truck to remove the vehicle. During this time Trooper Bullock had several normal interactions with the motorist. Once the tow truck driver arrived the man became upset with the cost of having the vehicle towed. He calmly walked back to Trooper Bullock’s vehicle and, without warning, drew a handgun and fatally shot him in the head. The man then attempted to shoot the tow truck driver, but his gun jammed, allowing the tow truck driver to run to safety. The tow truck driver was able to get the attention of an off-duty Riviera Beach detective who was driving into work. The detective fatally shot the subject after the man confronted him and pointed the gun at him. Trooper Bullock was a U.S. Air Force veteran and had served with the Florida Highway Patrol for 19 years. He is survived by his parents and two sisters. In December 2020, the Port Salerno post office was renamed the Trooper Joseph Bullock Building and I-95, where he was shot, was also renamed Trooper Joseph Bullock Memorial Highway.","BIO Age 42 Tour 19 years Badge 595 Military Veteran INCIDENT DETAILS Cause Gunfire Weapon Handgun Offender Shot and killed Disabled Motorist, Ambush Powered by Esri Zoom In Zoom Out Expand LODD Mapping FAQs",INCIDENT DETAILS Cause Gunfire Weapon Handgun Offender Shot and killed

Trooper Young was a member of the narcotics squad and was attempting to arrest a drug courier during a traffic stop. Two suspects were en route to Detroit, Michigan, on I-75 when they were stopped by Trooper Young. Consent was given to search the vehicle, during which Trooper Young discovered a substantial amount of cocaine. The amount was later determined to be 340 grams of crack cocaine. A violent struggle between the Trooper and suspects ensued, and one of the suspects gained control of Trooper Young's revolver and shot him in the face at point-blank range. The 42-year-old shooter and his 40-year-old accomplice were apprehended three hours later in a nearby swamp. The shooter was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to death. As of November 28, 2020, now 75, he remains on death row. Trooper Young served with the Florida Highway Patrol for three years and was assigned to Troop F. He was well known for his ability to spot a drug trafficker.

On August 13, 2010, with less than a year left in prison, he was in a work release program and failed to return to prison at the end of his shift. He was found sitting on a park bench in his urine in a very intoxicated condition. Trooper Smith had served with the Florida Highway Patrol for five years. He is survived by his wife, son, daughter, parents, and brother, who also served in law enforcement. Between 1985 and 1989, Trooper Smith was a pitcher for the Minnesota Twins.
