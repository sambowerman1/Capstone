Agent Ericsson was off duty, at home, when his wife came home and informed him that a vehicle had followed her and their children home from the grocery store and had attempted to run her off of the road. When Agent Ericsson went outside to investigate, the driver of the vehicle backed out of the driveway and fled.

After the vehicle finally stopped, Agent Ericsson attempted to subdue the driver, who was high on methamphetamine. During the struggle, the suspect was shot once in the chest as he began to drive away, dragging Agent Ericsson. Agent Ericsson was taken to Mercy Health Center in Oklahoma City, where he remained until succumbing to the injuries.
