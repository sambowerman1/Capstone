The Effects of COVID on Law Enforcement Beginning in early 2020, thousands of law enforcement officers and other first responders throughout the country began to contract COVID-19 during the worldwide pandemic. Due to the nature of their job, law enforcement officers were required to work and interact with the community even as the majority of the country was self-quarantined. As a result, hundreds of officers died from COVID-related illnesses and other complications. Corrections agencies, in particular, suffered tremendous losses due to the constant and close proximity between the corrections officers and large inmate populations. Since March 2020, ODMP has verified that over 900 law enforcement officers have died as the result of a confirmed or presumed exposure while on duty and continues to work with hundreds of other agencies that have suffered a COVID-related death.

The Effects of COVID on Law Enforcement Beginning in early 2020, thousands of law enforcement officers and other first responders throughout the country began to contract COVID-19 during the worldwide pandemic. Due to the nature of their job, law enforcement officers were required to work and interact with the community even as the majority of the country was self-quarantined. As a result, hundreds of officers died from COVID-related illnesses and other complications. Corrections agencies, in particular, suffered tremendous losses due to the constant and close proximity between the corrections officers and large inmate populations. Since March 2020, ODMP has verified that over 900 law enforcement officers have died as the result of a confirmed or presumed exposure while on duty and continues to work with hundreds of other agencies that have suffered a COVID-related death.

He was survived by his wife, two sons, a daughter, and seven grandchildren. The 9/11 Terrorist Attacks On the morning of September 11th, 2001, seventy-two officers from a total of eight local, state, and federal agencies were killed when terrorist hijackers working for the al Qaeda terrorist network, headed by Osama bin Laden, crashed four hijacked planes into the World Trade Center towers in New York City, the Pentagon in Arlington, Virginia, and a field near Shanksville, Pennsylvania. After the impact of the first plane into the World Trade Center's North Tower, putting the safety of others before their own, law enforcement officers along with fire and EMS personnel, rushed to the burning Twin Towers of the World Trade Center to aid the victims and lead them to safety. Due to their quick actions, it is estimated that over 25,000 people were saved. As the evacuation continued, the South Tower unexpectedly collapsed as a result of the intense fire caused by the impact. The North Tower collapsed a short time later. Seventy-two law enforcement officers, 343 members of the New York City Fire Department, and over 2,800 civilians were killed at the World Trade Center site on 9/11. A third hijacked plane crashed into a field in rural Pennsylvania when the passengers attempted to re-take control of the plane. One law enforcement officer, who was a passenger on the plane, was killed in that crash. The fourth hijacked plane was crashed into the Pentagon in Arlington, Virginia, killing almost 200 military and civilian personnel. No law enforcement officers were killed at the Pentagon on 9/11. The terrorist attacks resulted in the declaration of war against the Taliban regime, the illegal rulers of Afghanistan, and the al Qaeda terrorist network which also was based in Afghanistan. On September 9th, 2005, all of the public safety officers killed on September 11th, 2001, were posthumously awarded the 9/11 Heroes Medal of Valor by President George W. Bush. The contamination in the air at the World Trade Center site caused many rescue personnel to become extremely ill and eventually led to the death of several rescue workers. On May 1st, 2011, members of the United States military conducted a raid on a compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan, and killed Osama bin Laden.

The Effects of COVID on Law Enforcement Beginning in early 2020, thousands of law enforcement officers and other first responders throughout the country began to contract COVID-19 during the worldwide pandemic. Due to the nature of their job, law enforcement officers were required to work and interact with the community even as the majority of the country was self-quarantined. As a result, hundreds of officers died from COVID-related illnesses and other complications. Corrections agencies, in particular, suffered tremendous losses due to the constant and close proximity between the corrections officers and large inmate populations. Since March 2020, ODMP has verified that over 900 law enforcement officers have died as the result of a confirmed or presumed exposure while on duty and continues to work with hundreds of other agencies that have suffered a COVID-related death.

The Effects of COVID on Law Enforcement Beginning in early 2020, thousands of law enforcement officers and other first responders throughout the country began to contract COVID-19 during the worldwide pandemic. Due to the nature of their job, law enforcement officers were required to work and interact with the community even as the majority of the country was self-quarantined. As a result, hundreds of officers died from COVID-related illnesses and other complications. Corrections agencies, in particular, suffered tremendous losses due to the constant and close proximity between the corrections officers and large inmate populations. Since March 2020, ODMP has verified that over 900 law enforcement officers have died as the result of a confirmed or presumed exposure while on duty and continues to work with hundreds of other agencies that have suffered a COVID-related death.

He notified dispatch with a description of the vehicle but failed to respond to further communications. Other officers responded to the scene and located his body next to his patrol with a gunshot wound to the head. His murder had remained unsolved for five years until a man in jail on another charge confessed to being involved with it after undergoing a spiritual conversion. Investigators determined that Officer Horner had encountered several men in the cemetery who had robbed a hotel several hours earlier and were planning a bank robbery. He had the four suspects in the car exit at gunpoint; however, a fifth person had already exited the car before Officer Horner's arrival and was in a nearby orange grove. As the fifth suspect exited the orange grove behind Officer Horner, one of the suspects being held at gunpoint distracted him by engaging him in conversation. As Officer Horner backed up toward his patrol car, the fifth suspect attacked him from behind. The other suspects immediately joined in the struggle and disarmed him. One of the suspects yelled to the other to shoot him, and the suspect shot the officer in the back of his head with his own service weapon. The suspects then placed the handgun under his body and fled the scene. The subject who confessed to being involved was originally sentenced to life plus 107 years, but the sentence was later reduced to 15 years for his cooperation in testifying against the other men. The subject who shot Officer Horner was sentenced to life plus 10 years, but the United States Supreme Court later vacated his murder conviction, and prosecutors decided not to retry him for murder. He will be resentenced for his conviction of using a firearm during a crime of violence to kill another person and faces a possible life sentence. Officer Horner had served with the Haines City Police Department for 14 months. He is survived by his wife and six children.","BIO Age 35 Tour 1 year, 2 months Badge 29/228 INCIDENT DETAILS Cause Gunfire Weapon Officer's handgun Offender Sentenced to life Suspicious Vehicle Powered by Esri Zoom In Zoom Out Expand LODD Mapping FAQs","INCIDENT DETAILS Cause Gunfire Weapon Officer's handgun Offender Sentenced to life"

The Effects of COVID on Law Enforcement Beginning in early 2020, thousands of law enforcement officers and other first responders throughout the country began to contract COVID-19 during the worldwide pandemic. Due to the nature of their job, law enforcement officers were required to work and interact with the community even as the majority of the country was self-quarantined. As a result, hundreds of officers died from COVID-related illnesses and other complications. Corrections agencies, in particular, suffered tremendous losses due to the constant and close proximity between the corrections officers and large inmate populations. Since March 2020, ODMP has verified that over 900 law enforcement officers have died as the result of a confirmed or presumed exposure while on duty and continues to work with hundreds of other agencies that have suffered a COVID-related death.

The trooper and the civilian ""ride-along"", a 20-year-old college freshman, observed a vehicle stop several feet before the toll booth on the 836 Expressway. After Trooper Glascock pulled up behind the car, the driver pulled through the toll booth without paying. Trooper Glascock stopped the vehicle, and as he was getting out, the suspect began backing up. Trooper Glascock backed his vehicle up to avoid a collision. This happened several times, and at that point, Trooper Glascock told his ride-along that he intended to arrest the suspect. Trooper Glascock and the suspect both exited their vehicles and exchanged words. The suspect then fled back to his vehicle, where he retrieved a .38-caliber handgun and shot Trooper Glascock twice, killing him. The suspect then entered his vehicle. The ride-along unlocked the 12-gauge shotgun that was mounted in the patrol car, loaded it, and opened fire at the suspect. The suspect sped away, but not before the ride-along was able to fire four shots, wounding him. The ride-along then radioed for help. Trooper Glascock was transported to the hospital where he was pronounced dead. A massive manhunt ensued. Working with the description that the ride-along provided, along with a partial license plate of the suspect's vehicle, the police were able to identify the suspect. During the investigation, the suspect’s vehicle was recovered along with the 38-caliber Titen revolver used to kill the trooper. Roadblocks were set up all over Miami, and after two days, the suspect turned himself in because he was unable to get out of town. The 31-year-old suspect pled guilty to first-degree murder and was sentenced to life in prison. He was denied parole in 2011 and again in 2017. As of November 23, 2020, he was in prison. Trooper Glascock's murder spurred the state cabinet to buy bullet-resistant vests for all state troopers. Trooper Glascock had served with the Florida Highway Patrol for one year.

A homicide investigation showed that the driver had a driving record that included three accidents, one suspension, and over seven traffic infractions. However, this incident was ruled ""accidental"". The accident was later investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, who was looking into the possibility that the taxi-driver ran the roadblock intentionally because his three passengers paid him to do so. The three passengers were involved in a plot to kill a man in the federal witness protection program. All three passengers had fled the scene of the accident, leaving the taxi-driver alone.

Due to the nature of their job, law enforcement officers were required to work and interact with the community even as the majority of the country was self-quarantined. As a result, hundreds of officers died from COVID-related illnesses and other complications. Corrections agencies, in particular, suffered tremendous losses due to the constant and close proximity between the corrections officers and large inmate populations.

The wife of the sheriff, who was also a civilian employee of the Jackson County Sheriff's Office, was arriving home from the grocery store and talking on a radio phone with her husband when she noticed a man following her into her driveway. She notified the sheriff, who immediately alerted field units to respond to his home. Deputy Altman was the first unit to arrive at the home. He found that the sheriff's wife had been shot and killed. The two killers, armed with three handguns, then opened fire on Deputy Altman, killing him. The sheriff and two deputies arrived at the scene moments later and engaged the killers in a gun battle. Both assailants were shot and killed. One of the killers was also a suspect in the 2001 murder of his own wife, a case that the Jackson County Sheriff's Office investigated. It is believed that the suspect targeted the sheriff and his wife because civil litigation involving the life insurance of the murdered wife was recently dismissed by a judge. Deputies found ammunition, latex gloves, bleach, vinegar, handcuffs, duct tape, and trash bags inside the killer's vehicle. In addition, both killers wore disguises which included wigs and glued-on mustaches. Deputy Altman had served with the Jackson County Sheriff's Office for one year.

The Effects of COVID on Law Enforcement Beginning in early 2020, thousands of law enforcement officers and other first responders throughout the country began to contract COVID-19 during the worldwide pandemic. Due to the nature of their job, law enforcement officers were required to work and interact with the community even as the majority of the country was self-quarantined. As a result, hundreds of officers died from COVID-related illnesses and other complications. Corrections agencies, in particular, suffered tremendous losses due to the constant and close proximity between the corrections officers and large inmate populations. Since March 2020, ODMP has verified that over 900 law enforcement officers have died as the result of a confirmed or presumed exposure while on duty and continues to work with hundreds of other agencies that have suffered a COVID-related death.

The Effects of COVID on Law Enforcement Beginning in early 2020, thousands of law enforcement officers and other first responders throughout the country began to contract COVID-19 during the worldwide pandemic. Due to the nature of their job, law enforcement officers were required to work and interact with the community even as the majority of the country was self-quarantined. As a result, hundreds of officers died from COVID-related illnesses and other complications. Corrections agencies, in particular, suffered tremendous losses due to the constant and close proximity between the corrections officers and large inmate populations. Since March 2020, ODMP has verified that over 900 law enforcement officers have died as the result of a confirmed or presumed exposure while on duty and continues to work with hundreds of other agencies that have suffered a COVID-related death.

The Effects of COVID on Law Enforcement Beginning in early 2020, thousands of law enforcement officers and other first responders throughout the country began to contract COVID-19 during the worldwide pandemic. Due to the nature of their job, law enforcement officers were required to work and interact with the community even as the majority of the country was self-quarantined. As a result, hundreds of officers died from COVID-related illnesses and other complications. Corrections agencies, in particular, suffered tremendous losses due to the constant and close proximity between the corrections officers and large inmate populations. Since March 2020, ODMP has verified that over 900 law enforcement officers have died as the result of a confirmed or presumed exposure while on duty and continues to work with hundreds of other agencies that have suffered a COVID-related death.

The Effects of COVID on Law Enforcement Beginning in early 2020, thousands of law enforcement officers and other first responders throughout the country began to contract COVID-19 during the worldwide pandemic. Due to the nature of their job, law enforcement officers were required to work and interact with the community even as the majority of the country was self-quarantined. As a result, hundreds of officers died from COVID-related illnesses and other complications. Corrections agencies, in particular, suffered tremendous losses due to the constant and close proximity between the corrections officers and large inmate populations. Since March 2020, ODMP has verified that over 900 law enforcement officers have died as the result of a confirmed or presumed exposure while on duty and continues to work with hundreds of other agencies that have suffered a COVID-related death.

HERRMANN Detective Alick Herrmann died from illnesses he contracted from inhaling toxic materials as he participated in the rescue and recovery efforts at the World Trade Center site following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. Detective Herrmann had served with the New York City Police Department for 20 years and was assigned to the 100 Precinct Detective Squad. He is survived by his wife and two sons. The 9/11 Terrorist Attacks On the morning of September 11th, 2001, seventy-two officers from a total of eight local, state, and federal agencies were killed when terrorist hijackers working for the al Qaeda terrorist network, headed by Osama bin Laden, crashed four hijacked planes into the World Trade Center towers in New York City, the Pentagon in Arlington, Virginia, and a field near Shanksville, Pennsylvania. After the impact of the first plane into the World Trade Center's North Tower, putting the safety of others before their own, law enforcement officers along with fire and EMS personnel, rushed to the burning Twin Towers of the World Trade Center to aid the victims and lead them to safety. Due to their quick actions, it is estimated that over 25,000 people were saved. As the evacuation continued, the South Tower unexpectedly collapsed as a result of the intense fire caused by the impact. The North Tower collapsed a short time later. Seventy-two law enforcement officers, 343 members of the New York City Fire Department, and over 2,800 civilians were killed at the World Trade Center site on 9/11. A third hijacked plane crashed into a field in rural Pennsylvania when the passengers attempted to re-take control of the plane. One law enforcement officer, who was a passenger on the plane, was killed in that crash. The fourth hijacked plane was crashed into the Pentagon in Arlington, Virginia, killing almost 200 military and civilian personnel. No law enforcement officers were killed at the Pentagon on 9/11. The terrorist attacks resulted in the declaration of war against the Taliban regime, the illegal rulers of Afghanistan, and the al Qaeda terrorist network which also was based in Afghanistan. On September 9th, 2005, all of the public safety officers killed on September 11th, 2001, were posthumously awarded the 9/11 Heroes Medal of Valor by President George W. Bush. The contamination in the air at the World Trade Center site caused many rescue personnel to become extremely ill and eventually led to the death of several rescue workers. On May 1st, 2011, members of the United States military conducted a raid on a compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan, and killed Osama bin Laden.

The Effects of COVID on Law Enforcement Beginning in early 2020, thousands of law enforcement officers and other first responders throughout the country began to contract COVID-19 during the worldwide pandemic. Due to the nature of their job, law enforcement officers were required to work and interact with the community even as the majority of the country was self-quarantined. As a result, hundreds of officers died from COVID-related illnesses and other complications. Corrections agencies, in particular, suffered tremendous losses due to the constant and close proximity between the corrections officers and large inmate populations. Since March 2020, ODMP has verified that over 900 law enforcement officers have died as the result of a confirmed or presumed exposure while on duty and continues to work with hundreds of other agencies that have suffered a COVID-related death.

The 9/11 Terrorist Attacks On the morning of September 11th, 2001, seventy-two officers from a total of eight local, state, and federal agencies were killed when terrorist hijackers working for the al Qaeda terrorist network, headed by Osama bin Laden, crashed four hijacked planes into the World Trade Center towers in New York City, the Pentagon in Arlington, Virginia, and a field near Shanksville, Pennsylvania. After the impact of the first plane into the World Trade Center's North Tower, putting the safety of others before their own, law enforcement officers along with fire and EMS personnel, rushed to the burning Twin Towers of the World Trade Center to aid the victims and lead them to safety. Due to their quick actions, it is estimated that over 25,000 people were saved. As the evacuation continued, the South Tower unexpectedly collapsed as a result of the intense fire caused by the impact. The North Tower collapsed a short time later. Seventy-two law enforcement officers, 343 members of the New York City Fire Department, and over 2,800 civilians were killed at the World Trade Center site on 9/11. A third hijacked plane crashed into a field in rural Pennsylvania when the passengers attempted to re-take control of the plane. One law enforcement officer, who was a passenger on the plane, was killed in that crash. The fourth hijacked plane was crashed into the Pentagon in Arlington, Virginia, killing almost 200 military and civilian personnel. No law enforcement officers were killed at the Pentagon on 9/11. The terrorist attacks resulted in the declaration of war against the Taliban regime, the illegal rulers of Afghanistan, and the al Qaeda terrorist network which also was based in Afghanistan. On September 9th, 2005, all of the public safety officers killed on September 11th, 2001, were posthumously awarded the 9/11 Heroes Medal of Valor by President George W. Bush. The contamination in the air at the World Trade Center site caused many rescue personnel to become extremely ill and eventually led to the death of several rescue workers. On May 1st, 2011, members of the United States military conducted a raid on a compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan, and killed Osama bin Laden.

The Effects of COVID on Law Enforcement Beginning in early 2020, thousands of law enforcement officers and other first responders throughout the country began to contract COVID-19 during the worldwide pandemic. Due to the nature of their job, law enforcement officers were required to work and interact with the community even as the majority of the country was self-quarantined. As a result, hundreds of officers died from COVID-related illnesses and other complications. Corrections agencies, in particular, suffered tremendous losses due to the constant and close proximity between the corrections officers and large inmate populations. Since March 2020, ODMP has verified that over 900 law enforcement officers have died as the result of a confirmed or presumed exposure while on duty and continues to work with hundreds of other agencies that have suffered a COVID-related death.

The Effects of COVID on Law Enforcement Beginning in early 2020, thousands of law enforcement officers and other first responders throughout the country began to contract COVID-19 during the worldwide pandemic. Due to the nature of their job, law enforcement officers were required to work and interact with the community even as the majority of the country was self-quarantined. As a result, hundreds of officers died from COVID-related illnesses and other complications. Corrections agencies, in particular, suffered tremendous losses due to the constant and close proximity between the corrections officers and large inmate populations. Since March 2020, ODMP has verified that over 900 law enforcement officers have died as the result of a confirmed or presumed exposure while on duty and continues to work with hundreds of other agencies that have suffered a COVID-related death.

While en route to Europe, the terrorists transmitted their demands. The terrorists threatened to blow up the airplane with bombs, and to strengthen the impression that they had real bombs on the airplane, they told officials where they could find a bomb at Grand Central Station. Officers from the Bomb Squad were sent to investigate, and they removed a bomb from a locker at the station. They then removed the bomb to the department range at Rodman's Neck in the Bronx, where Officer Murray, along with three other officers, attempted to defuse the bomb by remote control. When they were unsuccessful in defusing the bomb by remote, they approached it. During their approach, the bomb exploded, killing Officer Murray and seriously injuring the other three officers. The five Croatian terrorists were arrested when the airplane they hijacked landed in Paris, France. All five suspects were returned to the United States, where the United States Government charged them with Air Piracy and by New York State with murder. All five suspects were convicted of air piracy, and in addition, two were convicted of murder. The two suspects convicted of murder were sentenced to life in prison, but that sentence was reduced in 1980. One suspect was paroled in 1989. The second was paroled in 2008 and then deported.

The two officers were struggling with two men when they shot and killed both officers. Other officers arrived at the scene and took both men into custody. It was later determined that both suspects used the same gun and each killed one officer. Both suspects, 21 and 66, were convicted of Patrolman Nicholson's and Patrolman Barnett's murder and sentenced to death. Both appealed and were granted new trials. The older suspect was again convicted of murder and sentenced to life. He applied for a pardon on February 7, 1936. At the other suspect's second trial a witness said he saw him with a pistol but said he never actually saw him shoot Patrolman Barnett. Several other witnesses testified that he told them that he did kill Patrolman Barnett. He was acquitted. The jury said there was not enough evidence for a conviction. On June 13, 1934, he was arrested for carrying concealed weapons and was in a very intoxicated condition. Because of other recent problems with him, the state sanity commission declared him insane an he was committed at the Tallahassee State Mental Hospital. He escaped from the Chattahoochee Mental Hospital along with another inmate on July 12, 1942. Both robbed and beat a man, 41, to death in Levy County, Florida, and were recaptured. Both were arrested along with his wife and another couple in Orlando. He admitted to the murder and then admitted to four unsolved murders in Miami which he was charged with. He was declared sane and executed in the electric chair on November 22, 1943.","BIO Age Not available Tour Not available Badge Not available INCIDENT DETAILS Cause Gunfire Weapon Handgun; .38 caliber Offender One acquitted; One sentenced to life Domestic Powered by Esri Zoom In Zoom Out Expand LODD Mapping FAQs","INCIDENT DETAILS Cause Gunfire Weapon Handgun; .38 caliber Offender One acquitted; One sentenced to life"

The Effects of COVID on Law Enforcement Beginning in early 2020, thousands of law enforcement officers and other first responders throughout the country began to contract COVID-19 during the worldwide pandemic. Due to the nature of their job, law enforcement officers were required to work and interact with the community even as the majority of the country was self-quarantined. As a result, hundreds of officers died from COVID-related illnesses and other complications. Corrections agencies, in particular, suffered tremendous losses due to the constant and close proximity between the corrections officers and large inmate populations. Since March 2020, ODMP has verified that over 900 law enforcement officers have died as the result of a confirmed or presumed exposure while on duty and continues to work with hundreds of other agencies that have suffered a COVID-related death.

Upon the deputy's arrival he asked for assistance from Alachua County. Deputy McCraw, who lived in Archer, went to the home in Meredith to assist with arrest. When they arrived at the residence the elderly homeowner warned the officers not to come in and then fired at the officers from a bed. Once the Coffee County deputy disarmed him, the man told the officers that the wanted man was in an adjacent room and warned them not to enter it. As Deputy Rain opened the door to the room he was struck by a shotgun blast fired by the subject. The man was able to flee from the house. He was shot and killed by a posse after wounding three other posse members. Deputy Rain had served with the Alachua County Sheriff's Office for one year.

The suspect was also wanted for the attempted murder of three Chicago police officers and a California police officer whom he had shot during previous arrest attempts. Agent Shanahan and other officers received information that the suspect would was driving a stolen car from New Mexico to a garage at 6238 S Princeton Avenue. Officers and Agent Shanahan set up a stakeou at the garage. When the suspect showed up, all the officers had left to get other officers to relieve them. Agent Shanahan, who was alone at the time, attempted to arrest the suspect and was shot by the man with an automatic pistol. On November 2nd, 1925, the suspect murdered Sergeant Harry Gray, of the Chicago Police Department, as Sergeant Gray attempted to arrest him. On November 27, 1925, Patrolman James Carroll and James Henry of the Chicago Police Department set up a stakeout at a saloon on South Halstead Street. They were sitting in a booth watching a nearby house from a window. Information had been received that the suspect's girlfriend lived in the house and the suspect was on his way there. As they were watching three men entered the saloon and announced a holdup. In a gun battle that resulted, Patrolman Carroll, Patrolman Henry, and a cab driver were killed. A patron was shot and seriously wounded as the three fled. After officials obtained statements from witnesses, they were convinced that one of the robbers was the suspect. After the suspect was apprehended on January 20, 1926, in St, Louis, by FBI agents, police took two of the witnesses to the Cook County Jail to take a look at the suspect. They said he was definitely not one of the three they saw. The three were never apprehended. The suspect was sentenced to 35 years in Illinois Penitentiary for the murders plus 15 years in Leavenworth for the auto theft. Killing an FBI agent was not a federal crime until 1934. The suspect, Martin Durkin, was one of Chicago's most feared criminals. He was known for shooting anyone who got in his way and was a suspect in other murders. The suspect was released from Leavenworth in 1954 and died in 1981. Agent Shanahan was the first FBI agent to be killed in the line of duty.

The Effects of COVID on Law Enforcement Beginning in early 2020, thousands of law enforcement officers and other first responders throughout the country began to contract COVID-19 during the worldwide pandemic. Due to the nature of their job, law enforcement officers were required to work and interact with the community even as the majority of the country was self-quarantined. As a result, hundreds of officers died from COVID-related illnesses and other complications. Corrections agencies, in particular, suffered tremendous losses due to the constant and close proximity between the corrections officers and large inmate populations. Since March 2020, ODMP has verified that over 900 law enforcement officers have died as the result of a confirmed or presumed exposure while on duty and continues to work with hundreds of other agencies that have suffered a COVID-related death.

Detective Rosado had served with the New York City Police Department for 31 years. The 9/11 Terrorist Attacks On the morning of September 11th, 2001, seventy-two officers from a total of eight local, state, and federal agencies were killed when terrorist hijackers working for the al Qaeda terrorist network, headed by Osama bin Laden, crashed four hijacked planes into the World Trade Center towers in New York City, the Pentagon in Arlington, Virginia, and a field near Shanksville, Pennsylvania. After the impact of the first plane into the World Trade Center's North Tower, putting the safety of others before their own, law enforcement officers along with fire and EMS personnel, rushed to the burning Twin Towers of the World Trade Center to aid the victims and lead them to safety. Due to their quick actions, it is estimated that over 25,000 people were saved. As the evacuation continued, the South Tower unexpectedly collapsed as a result of the intense fire caused by the impact. The North Tower collapsed a short time later. Seventy-two law enforcement officers, 343 members of the New York City Fire Department, and over 2,800 civilians were killed at the World Trade Center site on 9/11. A third hijacked plane crashed into a field in rural Pennsylvania when the passengers attempted to re-take control of the plane. One law enforcement officer, who was a passenger on the plane, was killed in that crash. The fourth hijacked plane was crashed into the Pentagon in Arlington, Virginia, killing almost 200 military and civilian personnel. No law enforcement officers were killed at the Pentagon on 9/11. The terrorist attacks resulted in the declaration of war against the Taliban regime, the illegal rulers of Afghanistan, and the al Qaeda terrorist network which also was based in Afghanistan. On September 9th, 2005, all of the public safety officers killed on September 11th, 2001, were posthumously awarded the 9/11 Heroes Medal of Valor by President George W. Bush. The contamination in the air at the World Trade Center site caused many rescue personnel to become extremely ill and eventually led to the death of several rescue workers. On May 1st, 2011, members of the United States military conducted a raid on a compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan, and killed Osama bin Laden.

The Effects of COVID on Law Enforcement Beginning in early 2020, thousands of law enforcement officers and other first responders throughout the country began to contract COVID-19 during the worldwide pandemic. Due to the nature of their job, law enforcement officers were required to work and interact with the community even as the majority of the country was self-quarantined. As a result, hundreds of officers died from COVID-related illnesses and other complications. Corrections agencies, in particular, suffered tremendous losses due to the constant and close proximity between the corrections officers and large inmate populations. Since March 2020, ODMP has verified that over 900 law enforcement officers have died as the result of a confirmed or presumed exposure while on duty and continues to work with hundreds of other agencies that have suffered a COVID-related death.

The Effects of COVID on Law Enforcement Beginning in early 2020, thousands of law enforcement officers and other first responders throughout the country began to contract COVID-19 during the worldwide pandemic. Due to the nature of their job, law enforcement officers were required to work and interact with the community even as the majority of the country was self-quarantined. As a result, hundreds of officers died from COVID-related illnesses and other complications. Corrections agencies, in particular, suffered tremendous losses due to the constant and close proximity between the corrections officers and large inmate populations.

Due to the nature of their job, law enforcement officers were required to work and interact with the community even as the majority of the country was self-quarantined. As a result, hundreds of officers died from COVID-related illnesses and other complications. Corrections agencies, in particular, suffered tremendous losses due to the constant and close proximity between the corrections officers and large inmate populations.

The Effects of COVID on Law Enforcement Beginning in early 2020, thousands of law enforcement officers and other first responders throughout the country began to contract COVID-19 during the worldwide pandemic. Due to the nature of their job, law enforcement officers were required to work and interact with the community even as the majority of the country was self-quarantined. As a result, hundreds of officers died from COVID-related illnesses and other complications. Corrections agencies, in particular, suffered tremendous losses due to the constant and close proximity between the corrections officers and large inmate populations. Since March 2020, ODMP has verified that over 900 law enforcement officers have died as the result of a confirmed or presumed exposure while on duty and continues to work with hundreds of other agencies that have suffered a COVID-related death. Visit ODMP's COVID-19 memorial listing every officer who has died as a result of a confirmed or presumed exposure.","BIO Age 27 Tour 4 years Badge 1946 INCIDENT DETAILS Cause COVID19 Incident Date Not available COVID-19, Communicable Disease Powered by Esri Zoom In Zoom Out Expand LODD Mapping FAQs","INCIDENT DETAILS Cause COVID19 Incident Date Not available"

The Effects of COVID on Law Enforcement Beginning in early 2020, thousands of law enforcement officers and other first responders throughout the country began to contract COVID-19 during the worldwide pandemic. Due to the nature of their job, law enforcement officers were required to work and interact with the community even as the majority of the country was self-quarantined. As a result, hundreds of officers died from COVID-related illnesses and other complications. Corrections agencies, in particular, suffered tremendous losses due to the constant and close proximity between the corrections officers and large inmate populations. Since March 2020, ODMP has verified that over 900 law enforcement officers have died as the result of a confirmed or presumed exposure while on duty and continues to work with hundreds of other agencies that have suffered a COVID-related death.

Detective Nieves had served with the New York City Police Department for 21 years. The 9/11 Terrorist Attacks On the morning of September 11th, 2001, seventy-two officers from a total of eight local, state, and federal agencies were killed when terrorist hijackers working for the al Qaeda terrorist network, headed by Osama bin Laden, crashed four hijacked planes into the World Trade Center towers in New York City, the Pentagon in Arlington, Virginia, and a field near Shanksville, Pennsylvania. After the impact of the first plane into the World Trade Center's North Tower, putting the safety of others before their own, law enforcement officers along with fire and EMS personnel, rushed to the burning Twin Towers of the World Trade Center to aid the victims and lead them to safety. Due to their quick actions, it is estimated that over 25,000 people were saved. As the evacuation continued, the South Tower unexpectedly collapsed as a result of the intense fire caused by the impact. The North Tower collapsed a short time later. Seventy-two law enforcement officers, 343 members of the New York City Fire Department, and over 2,800 civilians were killed at the World Trade Center site on 9/11. A third hijacked plane crashed into a field in rural Pennsylvania when the passengers attempted to re-take control of the plane. One law enforcement officer, who was a passenger on the plane, was killed in that crash. The fourth hijacked plane was crashed into the Pentagon in Arlington, Virginia, killing almost 200 military and civilian personnel. No law enforcement officers were killed at the Pentagon on 9/11. The terrorist attacks resulted in the declaration of war against the Taliban regime, the illegal rulers of Afghanistan, and the al Qaeda terrorist network which also was based in Afghanistan. On September 9th, 2005, all of the public safety officers killed on September 11th, 2001, were posthumously awarded the 9/11 Heroes Medal of Valor by President George W. Bush. The contamination in the air at the World Trade Center site caused many rescue personnel to become extremely ill and eventually led to the death of several rescue workers. On May 1st, 2011, members of the United States military conducted a raid on a compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan, and killed Osama bin Laden.

Patrolman Kendall was fatally shot twice by the man, armed with a rifle, as the officer entered the dark, lower hallway of the Shaverblock building located at 8 South Main Street. Officer Kendall had just started climbing the stairs toward the subject's second floor apartment, when the man, who was standing at the top of the stairs, shot him. The subject then retreated into his apartment and barricaded the entrance. A former police officer who observed Patrolman Kendall enter the building ran in after hearing the shot. He found Patrolman Kendall laying on the stairway and helped him out of the building. Patrolman Kendall was taken by ambulance to Jones General Hospital, where he died at 4:30 pm. A number of officers, including the chief of police and a deputy sheriff stationed themselves across the street from the suspect's apartment. After the suspect repeatedly threatened to kill other officers, and attempts to negotiate with him failed, he was shot when he appeared in the apartment's window armed with his rifle. After being shot, the suspect returned fire, then fell backwards into the room. According to later reports, Patrolman Kendall and his partner had tossed a coin to see who would enter the building to apprehend the subject. Patrolman Kendall lost the toss and proceeded to enter the building where he was killed. Patrolman Kendall had served with the Jamestown Police Department for one year, one month, and eight days. His badge, number 13, was retired in his honor, and is currently on display in the department's museum. Officer George Kendall had been recently married and was survived by his wife.

MORALES Sergeant Ivan Morales died as the result of cancer that he developed following his assignment to the search and recovery efforts at the World Trade Center site following the 9/11 Terrorist Attacks. Sergeant Morales served with the New York State Police Department for 17 years. His response to the 9/11 recovery was during his four year service with the New York City Police Department. He is survived by his wife, son, daughter, sister, nieces and nephews. The 9/11 Terrorist Attacks On the morning of September 11th, 2001, seventy-two officers from a total of eight local, state, and federal agencies were killed when terrorist hijackers working for the al Qaeda terrorist network, headed by Osama bin Laden, crashed four hijacked planes into the World Trade Center towers in New York City, the Pentagon in Arlington, Virginia, and a field near Shanksville, Pennsylvania. After the impact of the first plane into the World Trade Center's North Tower, putting the safety of others before their own, law enforcement officers along with fire and EMS personnel, rushed to the burning Twin Towers of the World Trade Center to aid the victims and lead them to safety. Due to their quick actions, it is estimated that over 25,000 people were saved. As the evacuation continued, the South Tower unexpectedly collapsed as a result of the intense fire caused by the impact. The North Tower collapsed a short time later. Seventy-two law enforcement officers, 343 members of the New York City Fire Department, and over 2,800 civilians were killed at the World Trade Center site on 9/11. A third hijacked plane crashed into a field in rural Pennsylvania when the passengers attempted to re-take control of the plane. One law enforcement officer, who was a passenger on the plane, was killed in that crash. The fourth hijacked plane was crashed into the Pentagon in Arlington, Virginia, killing almost 200 military and civilian personnel. No law enforcement officers were killed at the Pentagon on 9/11. The terrorist attacks resulted in the declaration of war against the Taliban regime, the illegal rulers of Afghanistan, and the al Qaeda terrorist network which also was based in Afghanistan. On September 9th, 2005, all of the public safety officers killed on September 11th, 2001, were posthumously awarded the 9/11 Heroes Medal of Valor by President George W. Bush.

The Effects of COVID on Law Enforcement Beginning in early 2020, thousands of law enforcement officers and other first responders throughout the country began to contract COVID-19 during the worldwide pandemic. Due to the nature of their job, law enforcement officers were required to work and interact with the community even as the majority of the country was self-quarantined. As a result, hundreds of officers died from COVID-related illnesses and other complications. Corrections agencies, in particular, suffered tremendous losses due to the constant and close proximity between the corrections officers and large inmate populations. Since March 2020, ODMP has verified that over 900 law enforcement officers have died as the result of a confirmed or presumed exposure while on duty and continues to work with hundreds of other agencies that have suffered a COVID-related death.

The Effects of COVID on Law Enforcement Beginning in early 2020, thousands of law enforcement officers and other first responders throughout the country began to contract COVID-19 during the worldwide pandemic. Due to the nature of their job, law enforcement officers were required to work and interact with the community even as the majority of the country was self-quarantined. As a result, hundreds of officers died from COVID-related illnesses and other complications. Corrections agencies, in particular, suffered tremendous losses due to the constant and close proximity between the corrections officers and large inmate populations. Since March 2020, ODMP has verified that over 900 law enforcement officers have died as the result of a confirmed or presumed exposure while on duty and continues to work with hundreds of other agencies that have suffered a COVID-related death.

The Effects of COVID on Law Enforcement Beginning in early 2020, thousands of law enforcement officers and other first responders throughout the country began to contract COVID-19 during the worldwide pandemic. Due to the nature of their job, law enforcement officers were required to work and interact with the community even as the majority of the country was self-quarantined. As a result, hundreds of officers died from COVID-related illnesses and other complications. Corrections agencies, in particular, suffered tremendous losses due to the constant and close proximity between the corrections officers and large inmate populations.

Deputy Seijos had served with the Orange County Sheriff's Office for 30 years. He is survived by his wife, five children, and three grandchildren. The Effects of COVID on Law Enforcement Beginning in early 2020, thousands of law enforcement officers and other first responders throughout the country began to contract COVID-19 during the worldwide pandemic. Due to the nature of their job, law enforcement officers were required to work and interact with the community even as the majority of the country was self-quarantined. As a result, hundreds of officers died from COVID-related illnesses and other complications. Corrections agencies, in particular, suffered tremendous losses due to the constant and close proximity between the corrections officers and large inmate populations. Since March 2020, ODMP has verified that over 900 law enforcement officers have died as the result of a confirmed or presumed exposure while on duty and continues to work with hundreds of other agencies that have suffered a COVID-related death. Visit ODMP's COVID-19 memorial listing every officer who has died as a result of a confirmed or presumed exposure.","BIO Age 54 Tour 30 years Badge Not available INCIDENT DETAILS Cause COVID19 Incident Date Not available Communicable Disease, COVID-19 Powered by Esri Zoom In Zoom Out Expand LODD Mapping FAQs","INCIDENT DETAILS Cause COVID19 Incident Date Not available"

The Effects of COVID on Law Enforcement Beginning in early 2020, thousands of law enforcement officers and other first responders throughout the country began to contract COVID-19 during the worldwide pandemic. Due to the nature of their job, law enforcement officers were required to work and interact with the community even as the majority of the country was self-quarantined. As a result, hundreds of officers died from COVID-related illnesses and other complications. Corrections agencies, in particular, suffered tremendous losses due to the constant and close proximity between the corrections officers and large inmate populations.

Due to the nature of their job, law enforcement officers were required to work and interact with the community even as the majority of the country was self-quarantined. As a result, hundreds of officers died from COVID-related illnesses and other complications. Corrections agencies, in particular, suffered tremendous losses due to the constant and close proximity between the corrections officers and large inmate populations. Since March 2020, ODMP has verified that over 900 law enforcement officers have died as the result of a confirmed or presumed exposure while on duty and continues to work with hundreds of other agencies that have suffered a COVID-related death. Visit ODMP's COVID-19 memorial listing every officer who has died as a result of a confirmed or presumed exposure.","BIO Age 58 Tour 25 years Badge 630 Military Veteran INCIDENT DETAILS Cause COVID19 Incident Date Thursday, June 18, 2020 Communicable Disease, COVID-19 Powered by Esri Zoom In Zoom Out Expand LODD Mapping FAQs","INCIDENT DETAILS Cause COVID19 Incident Date Thursday, June 18, 2020"

The Effects of COVID on Law Enforcement Beginning in early 2020, thousands of law enforcement officers and other first responders throughout the country began to contract COVID-19 during the worldwide pandemic. Due to the nature of their job, law enforcement officers were required to work and interact with the community even as the majority of the country was self-quarantined. As a result, hundreds of officers died from COVID-related illnesses and other complications.

As he dismounted his motorcycle he was struck with rifle fire. Almost three weeks later a 19-year-old youth drove into the parking lot of the sheriff's office in Carlyle, Illinois. He told a deputy he was broke and needed help. The deputy began questioning the youth when he noticed a large knife in his car. The youth grabbed the deputies' service revolver and shot him in the arm. As he struggled with the youth several other deputies came to his aid and the youth was taken into custody. As the deputies searched the car, somehow the youth slipped out of a window inside the sheriffs office and escaped. A short distance away he forced a man, his wife, and their child from their car and stole it. He went to Kansas City and asked a pedestrian for directions. He noticed blood on the boy from the struggle with the deputy. He called the police and he was arrested minutes later as he tried to steal gas for his car. Taken back to Carlyle, Pennsylvania State Police were waiting because of information received that he was Patrolman Brantlinger's murderer. They questioned him but left because they could not get enough information. He was convicted of several charges in Carlyle and sent to the Illinois Penitentiary. After a week in prison the suspect received a new cell mate. After a few days his cell mate who was a Pennsylvania State Trooper had the evidence needed for a murder charge. The suspect was transported back to jail in Carlyle. On March 2, 1934, extradition papers were being prepared when he escaped, stole a bicycle, and peddled his way to Centralia, Missouri, where he was captured four days later. Three days later he was back in Pennsylvania. On May 4, 1934, he was acquitted of Patrolman Brantlinger's murder. Even though a rifle found in the suspect's car was proven to be the murder weapon, his father, a former justice of the pease, testified his son was in bed asleep at the time of the murder. He was returned to the Illinois Penitentiary where he only had 10 months left to serve for the conviction of several charges including attempted murder of the deputy. He was paroled in April of 1935, spent the summer at home, and then was jailed in Carlyle where he was charged with the car he stole after he shot the deputy and escaped. On November 23, 1935, he was sentenced to 5 years. Patrolman Brantlinger had served with the Pennsylvania State Highway Patrol for almost two years and was survived by his mother.","BIO Age 27 Tour 1 year, 10 months Badge Not available INCIDENT DETAILS Cause Gunfire Weapon Rifle Offender Sentenced to life Burglary Powered by Esri Zoom In Zoom Out Expand LODD Mapping FAQs","INCIDENT DETAILS Cause Gunfire Weapon Rifle Offender Sentenced to life"

Due to the nature of their job, law enforcement officers were required to work and interact with the community even as the majority of the country was self-quarantined. As a result, hundreds of officers died from COVID-related illnesses and other complications. Corrections agencies, in particular, suffered tremendous losses due to the constant and close proximity between the corrections officers and large inmate populations. Since March 2020, ODMP has verified that over 900 law enforcement officers have died as the result of a confirmed or presumed exposure while on duty and continues to work with hundreds of other agencies that have suffered a COVID-related death.

Several members of a regional task force had gone to the home to question a family member about the man's whereabouts. After making contact with the woman, the officers were informed that the man was in the attic and possibly armed. Officer Yaslowitz, who served on the department's canine unit, had just started his shift, filling in for another officer, when he responded to the call. After searching the house they located the suspect in the attic where he convinced officers that he was going to surrender. As Officer Yaslowitz and a member of the United States Marshals Service, Marshal Scott Ley, made entry into the attic, the suspect shot Officer Yaslowitz twice in the head, and then shot the Marshal Ley in the groin, causing Marshal Ley to fall out of the attic. Officers assembled a rescue team to try to rescue Officer Yaslowitz from the attic, and Marshal Ley from a bathroom on the upper floor of the house. As Sergeant Baitinger passed under the opening of the attic to aid Marshal Ley, the suspect then fired from the attic, striking Sergeant Baitinger. A SWAT team used a tactical vehicle to breach a wall of the home and came under fire, but was able to recover Officer Yaslowitz.

The Effects of COVID on Law Enforcement Beginning in early 2020, thousands of law enforcement officers and other first responders throughout the country began to contract COVID-19 during the worldwide pandemic. Due to the nature of their job, law enforcement officers were required to work and interact with the community even as the majority of the country was self-quarantined. As a result, hundreds of officers died from COVID-related illnesses and other complications. Corrections agencies, in particular, suffered tremendous losses due to the constant and close proximity between the corrections officers and large inmate populations. Since March 2020, ODMP has verified that over 900 law enforcement officers have died as the result of a confirmed or presumed exposure while on duty and continues to work with hundreds of other agencies that have suffered a COVID-related death.

Detective Stafilias had served with the New York City Police Department for 21 years. He is survived by his wife, two children, a sister, two nephews, and a niece. The 9/11 Terrorist Attacks On the morning of September 11th, 2001, seventy-two officers from a total of eight local, state, and federal agencies were killed when terrorist hijackers working for the al Qaeda terrorist network, headed by Osama bin Laden, crashed four hijacked planes into the World Trade Center towers in New York City, the Pentagon in Arlington, Virginia, and a field near Shanksville, Pennsylvania. After the impact of the first plane into the World Trade Center's North Tower, putting the safety of others before their own, law enforcement officers along with fire and EMS personnel, rushed to the burning Twin Towers of the World Trade Center to aid the victims and lead them to safety. Due to their quick actions, it is estimated that over 25,000 people were saved. As the evacuation continued, the South Tower unexpectedly collapsed as a result of the intense fire caused by the impact. The North Tower collapsed a short time later. Seventy-two law enforcement officers, 343 members of the New York City Fire Department, and over 2,800 civilians were killed at the World Trade Center site on 9/11. A third hijacked plane crashed into a field in rural Pennsylvania when the passengers attempted to re-take control of the plane. One law enforcement officer, who was a passenger on the plane, was killed in that crash. The fourth hijacked plane was crashed into the Pentagon in Arlington, Virginia, killing almost 200 military and civilian personnel. No law enforcement officers were killed at the Pentagon on 9/11. The terrorist attacks resulted in the declaration of war against the Taliban regime, the illegal rulers of Afghanistan, and the al Qaeda terrorist network which also was based in Afghanistan. On September 9th, 2005, all of the public safety officers killed on September 11th, 2001, were posthumously awarded the 9/11 Heroes Medal of Valor by President George W. Bush. The contamination in the air at the World Trade Center site caused many rescue personnel to become extremely ill and eventually led to the death of several rescue workers. On May 1st, 2011, members of the United States military conducted a raid on a compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan, and killed Osama bin Laden.

The Effects of COVID on Law Enforcement Beginning in early 2020, thousands of law enforcement officers and other first responders throughout the country began to contract COVID-19 during the worldwide pandemic. Due to the nature of their job, law enforcement officers were required to work and interact with the community even as the majority of the country was self-quarantined. As a result, hundreds of officers died from COVID-related illnesses and other complications. Corrections agencies, in particular, suffered tremendous losses due to the constant and close proximity between the corrections officers and large inmate populations. Since March 2020, ODMP has verified that over 900 law enforcement officers have died as the result of a confirmed or presumed exposure while on duty and continues to work with hundreds of other agencies that have suffered a COVID-related death.

The Effects of COVID on Law Enforcement Beginning in early 2020, thousands of law enforcement officers and other first responders throughout the country began to contract COVID-19 during the worldwide pandemic. Due to the nature of their job, law enforcement officers were required to work and interact with the community even as the majority of the country was self-quarantined. As a result, hundreds of officers died from COVID-related illnesses and other complications. Corrections agencies, in particular, suffered tremendous losses due to the constant and close proximity between the corrections officers and large inmate populations. Since March 2020, ODMP has verified that over 900 law enforcement officers have died as the result of a confirmed or presumed exposure while on duty and continues to work with hundreds of other agencies that have suffered a COVID-related death.

Deputy Sheriff Broadhead served with the Polk County Sheriff's Office for 10 years. He is survived by his wife and five children. The Effects of COVID on Law Enforcement Beginning in early 2020, thousands of law enforcement officers and other first responders throughout the country began to contract COVID-19 during the worldwide pandemic. Due to the nature of their job, law enforcement officers were required to work and interact with the community even as the majority of the country was self-quarantined. As a result, hundreds of officers died from COVID-related illnesses and other complications. Corrections agencies, in particular, suffered tremendous losses due to the constant and close proximity between the corrections officers and large inmate populations. Since March 2020, ODMP has verified that over 900 law enforcement officers have died as the result of a confirmed or presumed exposure while on duty and continues to work with hundreds of other agencies that have suffered a COVID-related death. Visit ODMP's COVID-19 memorial listing every officer who has died as a result of a confirmed or presumed exposure.","BIO Age 32 Tour 10 years Badge 7473 INCIDENT DETAILS Cause COVID19 Incident Date Tuesday, July 27, 2021 Communicable Disease, COVID-19 Powered by Esri Zoom In Zoom Out Expand LODD Mapping FAQs","INCIDENT DETAILS Cause COVID19 Incident Date Tuesday, July 27, 2021"
