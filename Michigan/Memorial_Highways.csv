March 25, 1942 in Memphis Tennessee. Her father, the Reverend C. L. Franklin, moved 
the family to Detroit, Michigan in 1944. Aretha grew up singing gospel music in the choir 
of her father’s New Bethel Baptist Church in Detroit and soon became a star soloist. 
Gospel, however, was only part of her vocabulary. Jazz, blues, rock, and opera were all 
hers to command. Ms. Franklin said in an interview with the New York Times in 2007 that
her father had told her that she “would sing for kings and queens.” She added: “Fortunately
I’ve had the good fortune do so. And presidents.”
Ms. Franklin was dubbed the “Queen of Soul” in 1967 by Pervis “The Blues Man” Spann, 
after her performance at the Regal Theater in Chicago. She recalled, “[Spann] walked on 
stage one evening with a crown, and I went, ‘Whoooa, What is this?’” She embraced the 
newfound title, however, saying in 2015, “Who wouldn’t want to be called ‘Queen’?” 
During her decades-long career, Ms. Franklin had more than 20 number one R&B hits, 
nearly 50 Top 50 hits, singles sales that surpassed the $10 million mark, and 18 Grammy 
awards to her name.
She was the recipient of numerous honorary doctorates, including from Harvard, Princeton, 
Yale, Brown University, the University of Michigan, Wayne State University, BethuneCookman College, to name a few. She received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 
1979, received the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2005, and was the first woman 
inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1987. She was also a recipient of the 
Detroit News Michiganian of the Year Lifetime Achievement Award in 2018. The entire 
list of her honors and awards is too extensive to detail.

Ms. Franklin was also a supporter of civil rights and an advocate for social change. She 
was known to be a compassionate sponsor of Detroit area families in need of food, clothing, 
household items or financial assistance. Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan said, “Few people in 
the history of our city have been as universally loved or left as indelible a mark as Aretha... 
Throughout her extraordinary career, she earned the love—and, yes, the respect—of 
millions of people, not just for herself and for women everywhere, but for the city she loved 
so dearly and called home.” 
Aretha Louise Franklin died on August 16, 2018. She was 76 years old.

After months of brutal fighting between Japanese forces and the United States and its allies, on April 9, 1942, 10,000 Americans became prisoners of war (POWs) with the surrender of the Bataan Peninsula in the Philippines. The Japanese Army forcibly marched nearly 75,000 military POWs on a deadly 65-mile trek that would become known as the Bataan Death March. The Bataan Death March resulted in the deaths of approximately 9,000 Filipinos and more than 1,000 Americans and the torture and brutal treatment of tens of thousands of prisoners. In early May 1942, 11,500 Americans were surrendered on Corregidor, a fortress island in Manila Harbor. The surrender was the largest in United States military history. Over 26,000 Americans were held as POWs. Nearly 11,000 died in POW camps, aboard “hell ships,” or as slave laborers. It is believed only 15,000 returned home to their families.
